Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================
The goal of this project is to prepare a set of tidy data that can be used for further analysis. 


Collection of the raw data
--------------------------
The raw data for this project was obtained using the following url: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
The data was recorded from a group of 30 volunteers doing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.


Guide to create the tidy data file
----------------------------------

 1. Download the raw data from URL provided above.
 2. Unpack the .zip file in your working directory.
 3. Run the run_analysis.R script available in this repository.
